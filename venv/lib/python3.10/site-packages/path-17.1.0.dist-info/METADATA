``path`` (aka path pie, formerly ``path.py``) implements path
objects as first-class entities, allowing common operations on
files to be invoked on those path objects directly. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from path import Path

    d = Path("/home/guido/bin")
    for f in d.files("*.py"):
        f.chmod(0o755)

    # Globbing
    for f in d.files("*.py"):
        f.chmod("u+rwx")

    # Changing the working directory:
    with Path("somewhere"):
        # cwd in now `somewhere`
        ...

    # Concatenate paths with /
    foo_txt = Path("bar") / "foo.txt"

Path pie is `hosted at Github <https://github.com/jaraco/path>`_.

Guides and Testimonials
=======================

Yasoob wrote the Python 101 `Writing a Cleanup Script
<http://freepythontips.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/python-101-writing-a-cleanup-script/>`_
based on ``path``.

Advantages
==========

Path pie provides a superior experience to similar offerings.

Python 3.4 introduced
`pathlib <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html>`_,
which shares many characteristics with ``path``. In particular,
it provides an object encapsulation for representing filesystem paths.
One may have imagined ``pathlib`` would supersede ``path``.

But the implementation and the usage quickly diverge, and ``path``
has several advantages over ``pathlib``:

- ``path`` implements ``Path`` objects as a subclass of ``str``, and as a
  result these ``Path`` objects may be passed directly to other APIs that
  expect simple text representations of paths, whereas with ``pathlib``, one
  must first cast values to strings before passing them to APIs that do
  not honor `PEP 519 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0519/>`_
  ``PathLike`` interface.
- ``path`` give quality of life features beyond exposing basic functionality
  of a path. ``path`` provides methods like ``rmtree`` (from shlib) and
  ``remove_p`` (remove a file if it exists), properties like ``.permissions``,
  and sophisticated ``walk``, ``TempDir``, and ``chmod`` behaviors.
- As a PyPI-hosted package, ``path`` is free to iterate
  faster than a stdlib package. Contributions are welcome
  and encouraged.
- ``path`` provides superior portability using a uniform abstraction
  over its single Path object,
  freeing the implementer to subclass it readily. One cannot
  subclass a ``pathlib.Path`` to add functionality, but must
  subclass ``Path``, ``PosixPath``, and ``WindowsPath``, even
  to do something as simple as to add a ``__dict__`` to the subclass
  instances.  ``path`` instead allows the ``Path.module``
  object to be overridden by subclasses, defaulting to the
  ``os.path``. Even advanced uses of ``path.Path`` that
  subclass the model do not need to be concerned with
  OS-specific nuances. ``path.Path`` objects are inherently "pure",
  not requiring the author to distinguish between pure and non-pure
  variants.

This path project has the explicit aim to provide compatibility
with ``pathlib`` objects where possible, such that a ``path.Path``
object is a drop-in replacement for ``pathlib.Path*`` objects.
This project welcomes contributions to improve that compatibility
where it's lacking.


Origins
=======

The ``path.py`` project was initially released in 2003 by Jason Orendorff
and has been continuously developed and supported by several maintainers
over the years.
